# tic-tac-toe
A game of Tic Tac Toe created with JavaScript.

The objective of this project was to practice using factory functions and the module pattern, with the aim of minimising the use of global variables.

The code is structured around five objects:
1. Gameboard
2. Cells (that make up the board)
3. Players
4. Game controller (to control the flow of the game)
5. Display controller (to control what is rendered by DOM elements)

Finally, it uses an IIFE to attach an event listener to the "Start a new game" button, which kicks off or restart the game.

Note: I built this primarily on CodePen hence the lack of commit message.
